## 🌐 Your Site is Running!

**Local URL:** http://localhost:3001
**Network URL:** http://192.168.1.12:3001

The development server is running with Turbopack for fast refresh.

## 🛠️ Next Steps - Customization

### 1. Update Personal Info (Required)

**File: `src/app/layout.tsx`**
```typescript
// Change this:
title: "Robotics Engineer | Builder & Maker",
description: "Engineering student...",
authors: [{ name: "Your Name" }],
```

### 2. Replace Sample Data

**Projects (`src/components/Projects.tsx`):**
- Replace the 6 sample projects with your real projects
- Update images, GitHub links, tags
- Modify descriptions to match your work

**Experience (`src/components/Experience.tsx`):**
- Add your actual competitions, internships, research
- Update dates, organizations, achievements

**About (`src/components/About.tsx`):**
- Write your personal bio
- Update skills descriptions
- Add your photo (replace avatar placeholder)

**Contact (`src/components/Contact.tsx`):**
- Change email to: `your.email@example.com`
- Update GitHub URL: `https://github.com/yourusername`
- Update LinkedIn URL: `https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile`

### 3. Add Real Images

Create a folder for project images:
```bash
mkdir -p public/projects
```

Add your project images and update paths in `Projects.tsx`:
```typescript
image: "/projects/quadruped.jpg"
```

### 4. Integrate Contact Form

The form currently simulates submission. To make it functional:

**Option A - Formspree (Free):**
1. Sign up at https://formspree.io
2. Create a form and get your endpoint
3. Update `handleSubmit` in `Contact.tsx`

**Option B - EmailJS:**
1. Sign up at https://emailjs.com
2. Follow their Next.js integration guide

### 5. Customize Colors (Optional)

Edit `src/app/globals.css`:
```css
:root {
  --accent: #f97316;        /* Change orange to your color */
  --accent-hover: #ea580c;  /* Hover state */
}
```

## 🚀 Development Commands

```bash
# Development server (already running)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

## 🌍 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended - Free)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Visit https://vercel.com
3. Import your repository
4. Deploy automatically

### Alternative: Netlify
1. `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `.next` folder to Netlify

## 💡 Tips

1. **Test Dark Mode** - Click the moon/sun icon in the navigation
2. **Mobile View** - Resize browser or use DevTools to test responsiveness
3. **Smooth Scroll** - Click navigation items to see smooth scrolling
4. **Project Hover** - Hover over project cards to see descriptions
5. **Back to Top** - Scroll down to see the floating button appear

## 📝 Key Technologies

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations
- **Lucide React** - Modern icon library

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

This portfolio embodies the **builder/maker aesthetic**:
- ✨ **Minimal but polished** - No unnecessary elements
- 🔧 **Functional first** - Every section has a purpose
- 🚀 **Action-oriented** - Focus on what you've built
- 📱 **Accessible** - Works on all devices
- ⚡ **Fast** - Optimized performance

Perfect for robotics engineers who want a professional web presence without the fluff!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Port already in use?**
- The server automatically uses port 3001 if 3000 is busy
- Or stop the other process: `npx kill-port 3000`

**Dark mode not working?**
- Clear browser localStorage
- Refresh the page

**Animations not smooth?**
- Make sure Framer Motion is installed: `npm install framer-motion`

**Form not submitting?**
- This is expected - integrate a form service (see step 4 above)
